to do
- create great seed data. Events should have title, user, date, and date.object
- create tasks for those events and begin generating HTML dynamically


- check if any users exist once we can launch the server again. 
- create report class? 
    - Report.weekly
    - Events.this_week
    


    modify task select to only include the users evers ... not ALL events

    modify weekly tasks to print in order
