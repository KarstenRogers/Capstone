# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
## Application Description

My rails portfolio project is a simple calendar (hence the name) with features to add events, and their related tasks. The project is loosely modeled after googleâ€™s calendar feature. Each user may choose to create their own login, or to login with their google account.
Each user has the following features available to them. 
-Login with Google 
-Create an Event 
-Create a Task related to an Event
-The Week Ahead report which lists all events and tasks for the upcoming calendar week
-Error message generation upon submitting a form with invalid data.
## In order to get my application up and running


1. Using the terminal from the project's parent directory, enter the following commands
bundle install
rake db:migrate

2. Seed the database by entering command 
rails db:seed
3. Launch a local server with command 
rails s 
4. In your local browser, navigate to 
http://localhost:3000

5. Create an account or Continue with Google

6. Add events and their related tasks with the forms on the homepage!
